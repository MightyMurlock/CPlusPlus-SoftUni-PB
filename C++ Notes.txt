C++ Notes:

Use in every C++ project:
--->	#include <iostream>
	using namespace std;	//std - standard (instead of typing std:: everywhere)
				

To use math in C++
--->	#define _USE_MATH_DEFINES
	#include <cmath>

To format double numbers use:
--->	Option 1: cout.setf(ios::fixed);
		  cout.precision(2);
	Option 2: #include <iomanip> // iomanip - input/output manipulation
		  cout << fixed << setprecision(2) <<...

Whenever I have a variable that does not change in value and is constant:
--->	Add: const (variable) ....

setw(int x) ----> Can be used for input and output. It sets a restriction that is 		  equal to [int x], so that the input/output does not overstep said 		  restriction.
setfill(char a) ----> Used for output. If the output has a restriction on width, 		      setfill, fills the width of the output with a specified 			      character. 
		      -----> Both [setw] and [setfill] are used from the library 			     <iomanip>.

getline(sin, string a) ----> Reads everything on the line and appends it to the 			     string. This is used because [cin] can't read more two or 			     more words where there is a space between them. (You 			     don't need a [cin] after [getline].

To cast a variable to a different type:
---->	static_cast <new type> (variable)
